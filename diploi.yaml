# diploi.yaml - configuration to build and run this Python Flask app on Diploi
# This file instructs Diploi to install Python deps and start with gunicorn

build:
  type: shell
  commands:
    - python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip
    - pip install -r requirements.txt

run:
  command: gunicorn app:app -b 0.0.0.0:$PORT
  env:
    PORT: 5000

ports:
  - 5000

# Notes:
# - Diploi injects $PORT at runtime; we set default 5000 above for local testing.
# - If Diploi expects a slightly different schema, tell me the expected keys and I will adapt.
